A series of study notes that help me understand internals of tinygrad and equip me to contribute more to it.

The [quickstart guide](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) and [abstraction guide](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/blob/master/docs/abstractions2.py) are great resources, but they may not be very beginner friendly. A [bunch of tutorials](https://mesozoic-egg.github.io/tinygrad-notes/) created by Di Zhu are more digestable and helped me a lot. The following notes are meant to be even more detailed.
